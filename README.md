# R-Exercises
This is a repository with R corrected exercises that anyone can use to practice.
The proposed exercises are below, and the answers are in the Answers folder.

## Exercises

#### 1 - Using function runif() generate 20 random numbers between:

- 0 and 1
- -7 and 5
- 50 and 200


#### 2 - Create a function which sums two numbers: x and y

#### 3 - Create a function to simulate a die roll.

#### 4 - Create a function to simulate two dice roll.

#### 5 - Create a function to simulate ***n*** dice roll.

#### 6 - Create an object with letters A, B and C, repeating each one 15, 12 and 8 times respectively
- a) Display on the screen, logical vector, showing where are letters B in this object
- b) Check Help for function sum() and find out how to count the number of letters B in this vector, using sum()

#### 7 - create an object with 100 random values of an uniform distribution U(0,1). Count how many values are greater or equal to 0.5

#### 8 - calculate the first 50 powers of 2 ( e.g. 2^1, 2^2, 2^3.... 2^50) 
- a) calculate the square of the integers from 1 to 50 (e.g. 1^2, 2^2, 3^2,... 50^2)
- b) what pairs are equal, that is what integer numbers from the two previous exercises satisfy the condition 2^n=n^2
- c) how many pairs exist?

#### 9 - Create an object to store this matrix: 
2  8  4
0  4  1
9  7  5

- a) set names for the rows and columns of this matrix
- b) create a list (not named) with two elements: (1) one vector with letters  A, B, and C repeated 2, 5 and 4 times respectively; and (2) the matrix of previous exercise
- c) set names for these two elements of the list
- d) add one more component to this list, with cities names. It should be a vector of class factor with the values: "New York", "Houston", "Dallas"


#### 10 - Create a data frame to store two variables: place (A, B, C, D) and count (42, 34, 59, 18)

#### 11 - Create a data frame with the following columns: Name, Age, City
- after creating the initial data frame with your data, add a new row with someone else data
- add a new column with the favorite color of each person
